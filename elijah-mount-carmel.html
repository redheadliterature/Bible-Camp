    <p>In a time when Israel was led by wicked kings, the prophet Elijah confronted King Ahab and the people of Israel who had turned to worship the false god Baal. Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal to a contest on Mount Carmel to prove whose god was truly the one true God. Each side would prepare a sacrifice, but neither would light the fire. The god who answered by sending fire to consume the offering would be the true God. The prophets of Baal prayed and danced around their altar all day, but no fire came. Elijah then prepared his sacrifice, drenched it with water to make it more impossible to ignite, and prayed to God. Immediately, God sent fire from heaven that consumed the offering, the wood, the stones, and even the water in the trench around the altar. The people of Israel saw this and fell on their faces, proclaiming, "The Lord, He is God!" Elijah then ordered the prophets of Baal to be seized and put to death. This dramatic event proved God's power and led to the people returning to worship Him.</p>
