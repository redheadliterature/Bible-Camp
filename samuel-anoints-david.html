    <p>When Israel‚Äôs first king, Saul, disobeyed God, the prophet Samuel was sent by God to anoint a new king. God directed Samuel to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem, where one of Jesse‚Äôs sons would be chosen. Samuel initially thought God would choose Eliab, Jesse‚Äôs eldest son, because of his appearance, but God told him, ‚ÄúMan looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.‚Äù One by one, Jesse‚Äôs sons were presented to Samuel, but none of them were chosen. Finally, Jesse called his youngest son, David, who was out tending the sheep. When David appeared, God told Samuel to anoint him as king. Samuel poured oil on David‚Äôs head, marking him as the future king of Israel. From that day on, the Spirit of the Lord came upon David powerfully. Though David was young and humble, this anointing set the stage for him to eventually replace Saul as king and become one of Israel‚Äôs greatest leaders.</p>
