    <p>God called the prophet Jonah to go to the city of Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire, and warn its people to repent of their wickedness, or they would face destruction. However, Jonah didn‚Äôt want to go because the people of Nineveh were enemies of Israel, and he feared they might repent and be spared. So, instead of obeying God, Jonah fled in the opposite direction, boarding a ship to Tarshish. A great storm arose, and the sailors, fearing for their lives, cast lots and discovered that Jonah was the cause of the storm. Jonah admitted his disobedience and told them to throw him into the sea to calm the storm. Reluctantly, they did, and the storm ceased. Jonah was swallowed by a giant fish (often called a whale), where he spent three days and three nights in its belly. From within the fish, Jonah prayed to God, repenting for his disobedience. God heard his prayer, and the fish vomited Jonah out onto dry land. This time, Jonah obeyed God and went to Nineveh. He warned the people of their impending destruction, and to Jonah‚Äôs surprise, they repented and turned to God. God showed mercy and spared the city, which made Jonah angry. He felt that the Ninevites didn‚Äôt deserve God‚Äôs forgiveness, but God reminded Jonah that He is compassionate and merciful, wanting all people to repent and be saved.</p>
