    <p>Jesus was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion by the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. He was mocked, beaten, and forced to carry His cross through the streets of Jerusalem to a hill called Golgotha. There, Jesus was nailed to the cross between two criminals. As He hung there, He prayed for forgiveness for those who were crucifying Him, saying, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.‚Äù After several hours, Jesus cried out, ‚ÄúIt is finished,‚Äù and died. A soldier pierced His side with a spear to confirm He was dead. His body was taken down and placed in a tomb, sealed with a stone. The crucifixion of Jesus is seen as the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity, fulfilling God's plan of salvation.</p>
