    <p>God created Adam, the first man, and placed him in the Garden of Eden, a paradise where he lived in harmony with God and all creatures. God saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone, so He created Eve, the first woman, from Adam‚Äôs rib to be his companion. They were both naked and felt no shame. God gave them one command: not to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But the serpent tempted Eve, convincing her that eating the fruit would make her like God. She ate it and gave some to Adam. Their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked, feeling shame for the first time. God confronted them, and as a result of their disobedience, they were banished from the Garden. This act of disobedience brought sin into the world, affecting all of humanity from that point on.</p>
