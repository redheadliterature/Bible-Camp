    <p>After King David‚Äôs death, his son Solomon became king of Israel. Early in his reign, Solomon prayed to God for wisdom, asking for the ability to govern God‚Äôs people well, rather than asking for wealth or long life. Pleased with Solomon‚Äôs request, God granted him not only unparalleled wisdom but also wealth and honor, making him famous for his wise decisions. One of the most famous stories of Solomon‚Äôs wisdom involved two women who came to him, both claiming to be the mother of the same baby. Solomon proposed to cut the baby in half and give each woman half, but one woman immediately offered to give up her claim in order to save the child. Solomon then declared her the true mother, demonstrating his wisdom in discerning the truth. This judgment made Solomon renowned for his wisdom, and people from all over the world came to hear his insights. Solomon‚Äôs wisdom extended to matters of governance, justice, and even building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. His reign was marked by peace, prosperity, and a close relationship with God, though later in life, he allowed his many foreign wives to lead him astray, which led to the kingdom‚Äôs eventual division after his death.</p>
