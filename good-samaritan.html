    <p>One day, Jesus told a parable about a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho who was attacked by robbers. They beat him, stole his belongings, and left him wounded on the road. A priest and a Levite both passed by the injured man but ignored him. Then, a Samaritan, a person from a group generally despised by the Jews, came upon the man. Unlike the others, the Samaritan stopped, cared for the man‚Äôs wounds, took him to an inn, and paid for his care. Jesus used this story to teach that love and mercy should extend beyond social boundaries and that we should care for others, even our enemies, as the Samaritan did.</p>
