    <p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was empty and dark. God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light,‚Äù and there was light, which He called day, and the darkness He called night. God made the sky, separated the waters, and gathered the seas so dry land could appear. He created plants, trees, the sun, moon, and stars to give light, and filled the seas with fish and the sky with birds. Then, He made animals on the land and created man and woman in His own image, telling them to be fruitful and fill the earth. God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. On the seventh day, He rested from His work.</p>
