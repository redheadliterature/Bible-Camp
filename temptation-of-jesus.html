    <p>After Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness, where He fasted for forty days and nights. During this time, Satan appeared to Him and tempted Him three times, seeking to lead Jesus into sin. The first temptation was to turn stones into bread, as Jesus was hungry after His fast. Jesus responded by quoting Scripture, saying, ‚ÄúMan shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.‚Äù Next, Satan took Jesus to the pinnacle of the temple in Jerusalem and told Him to throw Himself down, suggesting that God would send angels to protect Him. Again, Jesus replied with Scripture, saying, ‚ÄúDo not put the Lord your God to the test.‚Äù Finally, Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if He would bow down and worship him. Jesus firmly rejected the offer, saying, ‚ÄúWorship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.‚Äù After these three temptations, Satan left, and angels came to minister to Jesus. The temptation of Jesus in the wilderness is significant because it shows His complete resistance to sin and His unwavering commitment to God‚Äôs will. It also highlights Jesus‚Äô use of Scripture to combat temptation, setting an example for believers in how to stand firm against the challenges and temptations of life. </p>
