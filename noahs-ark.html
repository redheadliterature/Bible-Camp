    <p>In a time when the world had become deeply corrupt and filled with violence, God saw that the people had turned away from Him. Grieved by the wickedness of humanity, God decided to send a flood to cleanse the earth, but He found favor with a righteous man named Noah. God instructed Noah to build a large ark, a massive boat, and to bring into it two of every kind of animal‚Äîmale and female‚Äîalong with his own family: his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Noah followed God's instructions, and after he and his family entered the ark, God caused the heavens to open and the earth to release waters, flooding the world for 40 days and 40 nights. The floodwaters covered the earth, destroying all living creatures that were not in the ark. After the rain stopped, the ark floated on the waters for months, and eventually, it came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. Noah sent out a raven and then a dove to find dry land. When the dove returned with an olive leaf, Noah knew that the floodwaters were receding. Once the earth was dry, God told Noah and his family to leave the ark and repopulate the earth. God made a covenant with Noah, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again. As a sign of this promise, He placed a rainbow in the sky. The story of Noah‚Äôs Ark teaches about God's judgment on sin, His mercy toward the righteous, and His covenant faithfulness.</p>
