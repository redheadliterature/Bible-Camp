    <p>After Jesus was crucified, He was buried in a tomb owned by Joseph of Arimathea. A large stone was rolled in front of the tomb, and Roman guards were stationed to ensure no one would steal His body. However, on the third day after His death, early in the morning, a powerful earthquake occurred, and an angel of the Lord rolled away the stone from the tomb. The guards were terrified and fell as if dead. When Mary Magdalene and the other women arrived to anoint Jesus' body, they found the tomb empty. The angel told them that Jesus had risen, just as He had foretold. The women ran to tell the disciples, but Peter and John ran to the tomb to verify the news. They saw the grave clothes lying there, but the body of Jesus was gone. Later, Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene outside the tomb, and then to His disciples, showing them His hands and side to prove it was truly Him. Over the next 40 days, Jesus appeared to many people, teaching them about the Kingdom of God and commissioning His disciples to spread the Gospel. The resurrection of Jesus confirmed His identity as the Son of God and the Savior of the world, offering hope of eternal life for all who believe in Him.</p>
