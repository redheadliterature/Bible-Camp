    <p>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, a group of wise men, or Magi, from the East saw a star in the sky that signaled the birth of a new king. They traveled a great distance, following the star to Jerusalem, where they inquired about the child. King Herod, troubled by the news of a new king, secretly called the wise men and asked them to find the child and report back to him. The wise men continued their journey and were led by the star to the house where Jesus was. They offered Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, each symbolizing aspects of His divine kingship, priesthood, and eventual suffering. After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they returned to their country by another route. The visit of the wise men is significant as it shows that Jesus‚Äô birth was recognized by people from far and wide, symbolizing His universal significance and the fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah.</p>
