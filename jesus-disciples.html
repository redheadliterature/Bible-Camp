    <p>Jesus called twelve disciples to follow Him and become His closest companions, whom He would teach, mentor, and prepare to carry His message after His death. These men came from various backgrounds‚Äîfishermen, tax collectors, and others‚Äîwith none of them being particularly extraordinary by worldly standards. Among them was Peter, a fisherman who would become a leader in the early Church; his brother Andrew, who was among the first to follow Jesus; James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who formed part of Jesus' inner circle; Matthew, a former tax collector who later wrote the Gospel of Matthew; and Thomas, known for his initial doubt about the resurrection. The group also included Bartholomew, Philip, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who ultimately betrayed Jesus. Despite their flaws and shortcomings, the disciples were deeply impacted by Jesus' teachings and actions, and after His resurrection, they were empowered by the Holy Spirit to spread His message and establish the early Church. Their lives and missions were foundational in the growth of Christianity, showing that Jesus called ordinary people to do extraordinary things through faith.</p>
