    <p>Jacob and Esau were twin brothers, sons of Isaac and Rebekah. Esau, the older of the two, was a skilled hunter, while Jacob was quieter and stayed at home. One day, Esau returned from hunting, famished, and asked Jacob for some stew. Jacob, seizing the opportunity, agreed to give him food only if Esau sold his birthright‚Äîthe special blessing and inheritance of the firstborn. Esau, in his hunger, agreed without thinking, selling his birthright for a bowl of stew. Later, when their father Isaac was old and blind, he intended to bless Esau before his death. Rebekah, favoring Jacob, helped him trick Isaac by disguising Jacob as Esau. Jacob received the blessing meant for Esau, and when Esau discovered the deception, he was furious. Jacob fled to avoid Esau‚Äôs wrath, eventually finding safety with his uncle Laban. Though their relationship was strained, later in life, Jacob and Esau reconciled. This story shows the consequences of deceit, but also the eventual healing of broken relationships.</p>
