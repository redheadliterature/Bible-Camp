    <p>Jesus was born to Mary and Joseph in the town of Bethlehem. Mary, a young virgin, was visited by the angel Gabriel, who told her she would conceive a child by the Holy Spirit and that her son would be the Son of God. Joseph, her fianc√©, was initially troubled but was reassured by an angel in a dream that the child was conceived by the Holy Spirit and that He would save people from their sins. Mary and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem for a census, and while there, Mary gave birth to Jesus in a stable because there was no room at the inn. Angels appeared to nearby shepherds, announcing the birth of the Savior, and they came to worship Him. Wise men from the East also followed a star to find Jesus, bringing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The birth of Jesus marked the fulfillment of prophecies and the beginning of God's plan to bring salvation to the world.</p>
