    <p>Daniel was a faithful servant of God in Babylon, and he held a high position in King Darius‚Äôs court. Some of the king‚Äôs officials, jealous of Daniel‚Äôs favor with the king, tricked Darius into issuing a decree that anyone who prayed to any god or man other than the king for 30 days would be thrown into the lion's den. Daniel, however, continued to pray to God three times a day, as was his custom. When the officials caught him praying, they reported him to the king, and despite Darius‚Äôs distress, he was forced to throw Daniel into the lion‚Äôs den. That night, God sent an angel to shut the mouths of the lions, and Daniel was unharmed. The next morning, King Darius was overjoyed to find Daniel alive. As a result, the king ordered that those who had falsely accused Daniel be thrown into the den instead, where they were immediately devoured. Daniel‚Äôs faithfulness to God was rewarded, and King Darius praised God for His protection.</p>
