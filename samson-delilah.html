    <p>Samson was a judge of Israel, known for his incredible strength, which was a gift from God. His strength was tied to his Nazirite vow, which included never cutting his hair. Samson fell in love with Delilah, a woman from the Philistine city of Sorek. The Philistine rulers saw this as an opportunity to capture Samson, and they offered Delilah a large sum of money if she could discover the secret of his strength. Delilah repeatedly asked Samson to reveal the secret, and after several failed attempts, he finally told her that his strength would leave him if his hair were cut, as this would break his Nazirite vow. Delilah betrayed him, calling for a Philistine barber to cut his hair while Samson slept. As soon as his hair was cut, Samson‚Äôs strength left him, and the Philistines captured him, gouging out his eyes and imprisoning him. However, while in prison, Samson‚Äôs hair began to grow back. During a Philistine celebration in the temple of Dagon, Samson prayed to God for strength one last time. God granted his request, and Samson pushed apart the temple‚Äôs pillars, causing the building to collapse, killing himself and thousands of Philistines.</p>
