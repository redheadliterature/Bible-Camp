    <p> After feeding the 5,000, Jesus sent His disciples ahead of Him in a boat to cross the Sea of Galilee, while He went up on a mountainside to pray. During the night, a strong wind made the boat struggle against the waves. As the disciples were rowing, they saw a figure approaching them, walking on the water. They were terrified, thinking it was a ghost. But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” Peter, eager to confirm it was Jesus, asked Him to command him to come to Him on the water. Jesus said, “Come.” Peter stepped out of the boat and began walking toward Jesus, but when he saw the wind, he became afraid and started to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus immediately reached out His hand, caught him, and said, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got into the boat, the wind stopped, and those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</p>
