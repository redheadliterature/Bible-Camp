    <p>God made a covenant with Abraham, promising to make him the father of a great nation. God told Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars and that they would inherit the land of Canaan. In return, Abraham and his descendants were to obey God and live according to His ways. God also gave Abraham the sign of circumcision as a symbol of the covenant. Despite Abraham and his wife Sarah being very old and having no children, God promised them a son, Isaac, through whom the covenant would continue. This covenant was the foundation of the Jewish people and marked the beginning of God’s special relationship with Israel.</p>
