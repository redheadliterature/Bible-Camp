    <p>Moses, who had fled Egypt years earlier after killing an Egyptian taskmaster, was living in exile in the land of Midian, working as a shepherd. One day, while tending his father-in-law‚Äôs flock near Mount Horeb, Moses saw a bush that was on fire but not being consumed by the flames. Curious, he approached the bush, and to his amazement, a voice called out to him from the flames, saying, ‚ÄúMoses! Moses!‚Äù When Moses answered, the voice revealed itself to be God‚Äôs, telling him, ‚ÄúDo not come any closer. Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.‚Äù God then introduced Himself as the God of Moses‚Äô ancestors‚ÄîAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob‚Äîand told Moses that He had seen the suffering of the Israelites in Egypt and had come to deliver them from slavery. God called Moses to be His messenger and lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. Moses was initially reluctant, doubting his ability to accomplish such a task, but God reassured him by promising His presence and giving him signs to prove His power, including the ability to turn Moses‚Äô staff into a serpent and his hand into leprous flesh and back. God also revealed His name to Moses as ‚ÄúI AM WHO I AM‚Äù (Yahweh), signifying His eternal, self-existent nature. Despite Moses‚Äô doubts and objections, God‚Äôs call was clear, and Moses eventually agreed to return to Egypt to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites to freedom. The burning bush marked the beginning of Moses' mission to liberate his people and become one of the greatest leaders in biblical history.</p>
