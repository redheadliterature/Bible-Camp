    <p>When Jesus was about 30 years old, He traveled to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist. John, who had been preaching repentance and baptizing people for the forgiveness of sins, was reluctant at first. He knew that Jesus was the Messiah and believed that he, rather than Jesus, should be baptized by Him. However, Jesus insisted, telling John that it was necessary to fulfill all righteousness‚Äîmeaning that His baptism was part of God‚Äôs plan and would publicly show His willingness to identify with humanity, even though He was sinless. So, John baptized Jesus, and as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in the form of a dove. At that moment, a voice from heaven declared, ‚ÄúThis is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased.‚Äù This powerful event marked the beginning of Jesus‚Äô public ministry and revealed His divine identity. The baptism symbolized the start of His mission to bring salvation to the world, and it was also a moment of affirmation by God the Father, confirming Jesus as His Son and the promised Savior. </p>
