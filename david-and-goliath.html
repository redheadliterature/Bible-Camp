    <p>The Israelites were at war with the Philistines, and a giant warrior named Goliath, over nine feet tall, challenged the Israelites to send out a champion to fight him. For forty days, Goliath taunted the Israelites, but no one dared to fight him. A young shepherd named David, the youngest son of Jesse, came to the battlefield to deliver food to his brothers. When he heard Goliath‚Äôs insults, David was filled with courage and volunteered to fight the giant. King Saul doubted him, but David insisted that God, who had helped him protect his sheep from lions and bears, would help him defeat Goliath. Armed with only a sling and five smooth stones, David faced Goliath. He slung a stone at Goliath‚Äôs forehead, and the giant fell to the ground, dead. David then took Goliath‚Äôs sword and cut off his head, bringing victory to the Israelites. This story highlights the power of faith and courage in the face of seemingly impossible odds.</p>
