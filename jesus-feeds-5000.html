    <p>One day, a large crowd gathered to listen to Jesus teach by the Sea of Galilee. As evening approached, Jesus‚Äô disciples were concerned that the people would be hungry and that there was no food to feed them. Jesus told His disciples to give the crowd something to eat, but they only had five loaves of bread and two fish, provided by a young boy in the crowd. Jesus took the bread and fish, gave thanks to God, and began breaking them into pieces. Miraculously, the food multiplied, and everyone ate until they were full. Afterward, the disciples gathered twelve baskets of leftover food. This miracle amazed the people, and many recognized Jesus as the prophet who was to come into the world. It was a powerful sign of Jesus' compassion, as well as His divine power to provide.</p>
