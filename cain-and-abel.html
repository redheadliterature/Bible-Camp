    <p>Cain and Abel were the sons of Adam and Eve. Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a shepherd. Both brought offerings to God: Cain offered produce from his crops, while Abel offered the best of his flock. God accepted Abel‚Äôs offering but rejected Cain‚Äôs, which made Cain very angry. God warned Cain that sin was waiting to overpower him, but he didn‚Äôt listen. In his jealousy and rage, Cain lured Abel into the field and killed him. When God asked Cain where his brother was, Cain replied, ‚ÄúAm I my brother‚Äôs keeper?‚Äù God punished Cain by making him a wanderer on the earth, but He also placed a mark on him to protect him from being killed by others. This story highlights the consequences of jealousy, sin, and the importance of offering our best to God.</p>
