    <p>After God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, they were led by Moses into the desert toward the Promised Land. Pharaoh, however, changed his mind and sent his army to recapture them. The Israelites found themselves trapped between the Egyptian army and the Red Sea. In their fear, they cried out to God, and Moses told them to trust in God's deliverance. God instructed Moses to raise his staff over the sea. As he did, the waters parted, and the Israelites walked through the dry seabed to the other side. When the Egyptian army pursued them, God commanded Moses to stretch his hand again, and the waters returned, drowning the soldiers. The Israelites were safe, and they sang songs of praise to God for His mighty deliverance. This event marked a key moment in their journey to the Promised Land and demonstrated God's power and faithfulness.</p>
