    <p>After the death of Moses, Joshua became the leader of the Israelites and was tasked with leading them into the Promised Land. One of the first cities they encountered was Jericho, a heavily fortified city with high walls. God instructed Joshua to march around the city with his army for six days, once a day, with seven priests carrying ram‚Äôs horn trumpets before the Ark of the Covenant. On the seventh day, they were to march around the city seven times, and when the priests blew their trumpets, the people were to shout loudly. On the seventh day, after they completed the march around the city, the priests blew the trumpets, and the Israelites gave a great shout. Miraculously, the walls of Jericho collapsed, allowing the Israelites to enter and take the city. They followed God‚Äôs instructions to the letter, and Jericho was defeated without a single battle. Joshua commanded that the city be destroyed, but the family of Rahab, a woman who had hidden Israelite spies and helped them, was spared because of her faithfulness. The fall of Jericho was a dramatic demonstration of God‚Äôs power and the Israelites‚Äô trust in His commands. It marked the beginning of their conquest of the Promised Land.</p>
